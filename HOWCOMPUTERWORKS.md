## What makes a computer ?
1. **input** <br/>
devices take data from outside of the computer and send it to the computer
  -  Keyboards
  -  Touch screens
  -  Mouse
  -  Digital cameras
  -  Microphone
2. **storage** <br/>
devices are capable of storing
 data for later processing or reading.  
 - Universal Serial Bus (USB)
 - Hard disk drives (HDDs)
 - Solid-state drives (SSDs)
 - Optical drives (CDs / BluRay / DVD)
3. **processing** <br/>
Central Processing Unit (CPU), This part of the computer takes information that is inputted by the user and processes the information by calculating, comparing and copying it.
4. **output** <br/>
devices displays information or printing information out so that it is useful to humans. There needs to be
  - screen
  - speakers
  - printers

## How do we store or represent information using electricity ?
In a computer, information travels over wires. The easiest way to convey information in a wire is to consider it "on" or "off",<br/>
An "on" wire represents 1, and an "off" wire represents 0, <br/>
This on / off state of a single wire is called a **bit**
<br/>
<br/>
**Bit** is the smallest piece of information of a computer can store,
<br/> it can be 0 or 1

## How computers represent numbers, words, images, and sound ?
1. **numbers** <br/>
Numbers in computers are represented in <br/> `binary number system 1 -> 10 | 2 -> 01`
- **Text, image and sound can also be represented with numbers**
2. **text** <br/>
Every letter is represented by binary number, for ex <br/> `ASCII code A -> 01000001 | B -> 01000010`   
3. **images** <br/>
All of the images are made out of teeny dots called pixels, and each pixel has a color, and each color represented with numbers <br/> `RGB; Red -> #ff0000 | Green -> #00ff00 | Blue -> #0000ff `
4. **sound** <br/>
Every sound is basically a series of vibrations in the air, vibrations can be represented graphically as a waveform, any point on this waveform can be represented by a number

## Computer Processing
### introduction
Every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information which can be represented by one or zero. <br/>
### computer processing
In order to process the input information to be an output, the computer needs to modify and combine the input signals, to do this, <br/> the computer uses millions of teeny electric components which come together from circuits `logic gates` <br/>

### logic gate
A logic gate is a physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.<br/>
